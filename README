README


 Arithmetic.cpp
----------------
Arithmetic.cpp is the overall client file that is used to implement and test
the full functionality of the BigInteger ADT. It performs several math operations
of varying complexity to demonstrate the capabilites of BigInt 

 BigInteger.cpp
----------------
 BigInteger.cpp is the actual implementation of BigInteger math operations as defined
 inside of BigInt.h. it is written with the List ADT created in pa5 and features
 several private helper functions in order to reduce the complexity of the
 actual functions that do the BigInt operations.

 BigInteger.h
--------------
BigInteger.h holds the public function definitions that are available to
whatever client wants to use it. it does not define some helper functions and
internal operations in order to maintain the security and effectiveness of its use

 BigIntegerTest.cpp
--------------------
BigIntegerTest is what I used to do the tests for individual functions in order to 
guarantee full functionality and to debug edge cases that were unconsidered during 
original testing but that were encountered during the grading script testing

List.cpp
----------
Written by me, List.cpp implements the functions described in List.h.
This is the obvious brains of the operation, and hides unnecessary or
sensitive data from the user in order to have full functionality.

List.h
--------
Provided by Tantalo, List.h describes what functions are available to the
client. also provides pre-conditions for use that must be met in order
for correct functionality.

ListTest.cpp
--------------
ListTest.cpp was created by me and implemented to pass the ListClient tests.In addition ListTest was used to test the corner cases and failed 
tests from the grading script in order to efficiently debug. The entire 
file is now commented out as I commented out passed tests in order 
to keep it as simple as posssible to read and debug.

Makefile
---------
Provided by Tantalo with minimal adjustments to allow list test and biginteger test
to compile and run. controls creation/deletion of .o and bin files

look at us, who wouldve thought... not me ! Once again shout out to my
boys andrew and vincent, goated tutors if I have ever witnessed it
This is the readme where you read about my functions
